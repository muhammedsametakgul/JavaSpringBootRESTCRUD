Entity -> This part is template for us and our database. It is a representation of database. <br><br>
DAO -> This part carry our methods for CRUD.<br><br>
Service-> When we use the methods in restcontroller, we implement service. In service, we have DAO methods. It is actually a bridge between DAO and Restcontroller. <br><br>
Restcontroller -> We are making mapping operations in this section.
